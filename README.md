# Telco---Exercises
## The code analyzes customer data by creating a DataFrame with `customerID` and `MonthlyCharges`, visualizing `Contract` types in a pie chart, counting `MultipleLines` customers, extracting min/max `tenure`, comparing `MonthlyCharges` by `gender`, checking if yearly contract customers pay more
### Assignment from SGH
Task:
Create a dataframe containing 'customerID' and 'MonthlyCharges'
Show on a pie chart the proportions of possible types of 'Contract'
Get the number of customers that have Multiple Lines. Show the result as value of a single variable 
What are the minimum and maximum values of tenure? Show these as single variables.
What are the monthly charges depending on the gender of the customer?
Do customers who have a yearly contract pay on average more than the others? Return the result as a single bool variable. Please note that others in this context means that we treat together both the Two year and month-to-month customers.
Create a column that will show the average charges computed as a division of Total Charges by tenure
